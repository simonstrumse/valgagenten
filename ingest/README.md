Ingest pipeline for RAG (documents + embeddings).

Usage from web/ folder:

- npm run ingest:pg         # reads from ../programmer, moves processed files to ../storage/ingested

The script extracts text per PDF page, segments, creates embeddings, and upserts to Supabase.
After success, it moves the original PDF to storage/ingested/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<party>/ with a normalized filename:

- Pattern: <PARTY>-<YEAR>-<slug>.pdf (ASCII, lowercase, hyphenated)
- Examples: H-2021-hoyres-stortingsvalgprogram.pdf, SV-2023-prinsipprogram.pdf
- Collisions: a numeric suffix is appended (-1, -2, â€¦)
